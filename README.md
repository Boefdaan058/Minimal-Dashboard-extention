# Minimal-Dashboard-extention
i want to create my own homepage Features: - Clock – live digital or analog clock. - Daily Quote – fetch from an API or use local list. - Favorite Sites – like Homarr, add/manage sites via UI. - Pomodoro Timer – with persistence so closing the tab doesn't reset it. - Animated Background – choose 2 colors and it will animate using the animejs
